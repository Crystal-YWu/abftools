\item{episode}{episodes to calculate membrane properties.}

\item{epoch}{epoch of the step pulse.}

\item{dac}{DAC channel of Vcmd}

\item{current_channel}{current channel.}

\description{
Calculate membrane properties from a step pulse membrane test.
}
\details{
This function calculates membreane properties given a proper step
pulse is applied and recorded in the abf object. Usually all arguments can
be determined automatically. By default episode is determined by
\code{\link[abftools:FindStepEpisode]{FindStepEpisode()}}, see help for more
details.

Please also notice that all unit prefixes are converted to "1", thus the
returned properties calculated are:

Cm: membrane capacitance (in Farad)

Rs: series resistance (in Ohms)

Rm: membrane resistance (in Ohms)

I0: Max charging current (in A)

Is: Steady current (in A)

tao: RC time constant (in s)
}
