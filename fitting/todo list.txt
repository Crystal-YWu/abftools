Fitting TODO:

----What Clampfit provides---- [comment]
Analyze:
  Quick Graph: I-V, Trace v Trace [? not sure what Trace v Trace does ?]
  Histogram [R built-in]
  Fitting to various pre-def function [easy to implement w/ extern package]
  Power spectrum [easy to implement w/ extern package]
  Statistic: [mostly R built-in]
    peak amp
    time of peak
    antipeak amp
    time of antipeak
    mean
    sd
    area
    half-w [need def]
    max rise slope
    time max rise slope
    max decay slope
    time max decay slope
    slope
    baseline
    rise slope [need def]
    rise time
    decay slope [need def]
    decay time
  Resistance [IV summary]
  Average: [R built-in]
    episodes
    files
  Concatenate files [? what's the point ?]
  Normalisation [R built-in]
  Various arithmetic [array]
  Adjust:
    baseline
    leak subtraction [need lit. on methodology]
    waveform
  Data reduction: [alt. to melt.abf]
    sampling
    avg
    minmax
  Force values [MskEpi]

Event Detection:
  [may need to design a convenient data structure]

Freq filter:
  [??? abf data is not in freq domain, how to filter ???]
